imageResizer
============
That is a image resizer demo using Symfony.  
To run this code you need have installed:

PHP (I use version 7.1);  
Composer(I use version 1.6);  
And need [Symfony 3.3 requirements](http://symfony.com/doc/3.3/reference/requirements.html).

------------
After this, run in terminal the following lines: 
``` 
composer update  
php bin/console server:run
```
------------
With this you probably can run this demo, to test you need access the route "/image/resize".
